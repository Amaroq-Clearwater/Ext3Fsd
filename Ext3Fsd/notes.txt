    8, FIXME: return zero-content for sparse file gaps
    9, FIXME: check available spaces before blocks allocation
   10, FIXME: refresh stale root dir content after journal replay
   11, FIXME: incompatible dentry management for 64k block size

    Since 0.38, Ext2fsd is much stable even under heavy i/o loads,
    both for reading and writing. Performance and stability are
    highly, improved especially stability. A new and strong era of
    Ext2Fsd in product shape is coming :)

WARNINGS:
 
    The driver may crash your system and ruin your data unexpectedly,
    since there might be software conflicts and I could only test it
    on some of the popular platforms. You should use it with care and
    use it at your own risk!
